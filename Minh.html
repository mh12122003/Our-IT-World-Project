        <p>Le Hoang Anh Minh - Report Writer</p>
        <p class="p1">
            <p1> Hello everyone, my name is Le Hoang Anh Minh, my English name is Mia and I am from the team. I’m a first-year student at RMIT with a major in Bachelor of Information Technology.  I was born in Ho Chi Minh city but my hometown is in Hanoi, and I’m very proud of that. 
                Everyone was surprised by that because I speak with a southern accent. In addition, I like cooking food and dessert, it makes me feel happy and relaxed. It can be said that that is the time when I feel most comfortable and be myself, I also have a passion to open a kitchen of my own. 
                And there, I will spend my free time discovering and practicing more recipes for new dishes, that is for me to develop my skills so that I can open a small restaurant for myself.  Besides that, Psychology is one of the things I admire, this isn’t related to my major. 
                This is probably the industry that I love most so far, although it is not really widely developed yet, but with scientific statistics that today young people have a very high risk of suffering from depression. . 
                And so, for me, this industry is very important because it allows me to heal myself and help others to think in a positive way.

            <p3><b>Career Plan</b></p3>
        <p class="p2">
            <p2> My career arrangement isn't very related to my current major because it tends to be a lot of psychology. 
                It's one thing I've really enjoyed since I used to be in high school, however what I learn currently will be very helpful within the future. I need to target my passion. 
                Once I even have a solid foundation, I'll learn more things that may in all probability facilitate ME later just like the current IT industry.
