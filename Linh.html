        <p>Duong Tran My Linh - UI/UX Designer</p>
        <p class="p1">
            <p1>Greetings! I go by both my Vietnamese name, which is Duong Tran My Linh, and my Chinese name, Yun Mei Ling, as my dad was a Chinese businessman who immigrated to Vietnam mainly because of the prosperous growing economy here. 
                Initially, I was an undergraduate at Foreign Trade University, one of the most prestigious universities in Vietnam, majoring in Banking and Finance. 
                The fact that I had almost zero IT background compared to my coursemates, who either took up coding when they were young or are naturally gifted and intelligent, was one of the reasons that made people doubt my ability to keep up with this IT major at first. 
                Nonetheless, what led me to the momentous decision of transferring to RMIT and switching to an Information Technology major, which is drastically different from my old one and is extremely male-dominated, was that I wanted to grab the opportunity of the limitless potential of technological applications in the economy, such as blockchain and cryptocurrency, and in our daily life. 
                Furthermore, I want to change societyâ€™s perceptions and typical stereotypes which are always held against women and invalidate their true potential, in this particular technology field. Thanks to my previous academic credentials as a business major, I specialize in analyzing data and insights that support decision-making. 
                Henceforth, the prominent role of implementing all of the user requirements and enhancing their experience by optimizing the graphic elements and building navigation components, or being a UI/UX designer, in short, will be dedicatedly fulfilled by me in our IT Project.
