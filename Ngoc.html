        <p class="p1">
            <p1>Hi, I am Hong Ngoc with the student ID s3938020. My mom comes from Hanoi but because I was born and raised in Saigon, I am only able to understand the Northern Vietnamese accent but not be able to use it. Of all my hobbies, I enjoy watching CSI TV series and football matches the most. Both hobbies enable me to realize how much I love seeing the world from different angles and analyzing the surroundings. This realization leads me, although not very directly, to the IT world, or the world of data science to be specific. 
                Joining this course with only a few basic C++ knowledge does not seem to be a disadvantage to me, because the less I know, the bolder I am when making projects - because I see it as an opportunity for me to learn from testing and experimenting.

            <p3><b>Career Plan</b></p3>
        <p class="p2">
            <p2>At this point, data analyst is my dream job since I want to use my observation and knowledge to tell a story from raw data. I want to optimize my time studying at RMIT University to be the best version of myself before getting to work with other members of the data analyst team and other related teams such as data scientists and data engineers. 
                Also, I am still seeking an efficient learning method, so that I can begin practicing some small projects to hone my skills.
