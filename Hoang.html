        <p><b>Ngo Minh Hoang - Web Developer</b></p>
        <p class="p1">
        <p1>Hello, my name is Ngo Minh Hoang and my student ID is s3926829. I was born in Hanoi, but my family moved to Ho Chi Minh City when I was 10, and now I am currently a freshman at RMIT Vietnam’s SGS Campus.
            About my hobbies, football and chess are the two most enjoyable activities for me in my leisure time. Although I am not very good at playing it myself, watching the professional players competing is something I can do all day. 
            Talking about football – the most popular sport in the world, in recent years, the impact of technology on it is incredible. AI is used to analyze in-match statistics, AR and VR are used to enhance the live broadcast and allow the fans at home to view the action as if they were in the stadium, and much more. 
            All those things really influenced my experience of enjoying the game as a viewer, making me amazed at how “miraculous” it is, and it became one of my reasons to choose IT as my major. 
            I am extremely interested in the way technology affects our daily life and want to use my knowledge in this field to help contribute to the development of our society, bringing a better life to other people. 
            I used to take part in some IT-related projects back in secondary school, such as creating a game or building a simple website. 
            However, that was the story of many years ago, and now I have to learn everything again from zero. Without a doubt, this project could not be a better opportunity for me to gain more experience and start working on projects that will change our life.

            <p2>
            At the moment, I haven’t had a clear career plan yet. Two minors for IT students at RMIT that I am interested in are Data Analytics and Mobile & Web Development. 
            Being a data analyst or a programmer either sounds cool, but I am not sure which one would be more suitable for me. 
            My ideal job would be something that relates to my hobbies, but it doesn’t matter if I can have it or not since the technology itself is enough to fascinate me.
