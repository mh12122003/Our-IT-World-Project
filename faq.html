        <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1> 

        <h2>Why using QR code, but not changing the labels' material?</h2>
        <p>
            The answer simply because, it is cost-saving. Stop using paper label is indispensable, but using another material that 
            is not paper and saves the environment simultaneously may cost quite a lot. So instead of printing the whole label, we 
            now only need to print a QR Code, and let your phones do the rest.

        <h2>Doesn't scanning QR Code sounds inconvienient?</h2>
        <p>
            Well, you have your point. Who carries their phones into the bathroom, right? However, things actually have changed. 
            People rely on their phone so much that they can even watch Tiktok while brushing their teeth and removing their makeup, and
            listening to music while taking a bath. Scanning QR Code therefore, is simple than ever.
