        <p>Ton Nu Ngoc Khanh - Report Writer</p>
        <p class="p1">
            <p1> Howdy, my name is Ton Nu Ngoc Khanh, and one of the things I'm proud of is that my surname originates from a Hue royal. 
                Everyone calls me Mango, s3932105 is the RMIT ID number to recognize me in RMIT. I've lived in Ho Chi Minh City for 19 years, where I cherish my precious memories with my relatives and friends, and I believe I will spend my whole dream here. 
                Thanks to various scientific films, I've been fascinated with artificial intelligence since I was in grade 11. By the way, this is my first semester and my first step into AI, which was a dream come true. My hobbies used to be quite childish when I spent all of my time watching Netflix and listening to music, 
                but I've recently noticed that since entering this new school environment, I've gradually changed; instead of watching Mukbang videos on Youtube, I now listen to videos about Python, HTML, and even CSS, which I find fascinating. 
                Living in an increasingly contemporary world packed with everything inspires me to think about how I might help create technologies that will safeguard people and the environment in the future.
