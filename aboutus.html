        <h1>Our Story</h1> 
        <p>
            Have you ever feel annoyed using products with paper labels? You want to read the information about those products 
            but end up seeing nothing because the ink is blurred out? Calm down, because we are here for you. Noticing such difficulty, 
            we come up with the idea of replacing those paper labels with tiny but effective QR Codes. From now on, all you need to do 
            is scan the QR Code on the product, and this website will provide you,not only information, but other powerful features.
